Q.	How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?                         

The diff showed only those lines that were changed or added later. If a long
code needs to be reviewed, it becomes tedious to go through the whole thing
and find the bug in it or a difference.

Q.	How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
more efficient programmer in the long term?

We can know what changes were made at what point og time. It makes it easy to 
retrace our steps if we have made a mistake in one of the older version.
